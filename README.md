# Say-Way-Segue-
Following the instructions of Mark Price to learn segues. Added more design and features.

Implementation of TextField to send dynamic data to different screen:

1. Added a text field component and added to second screen
2. Reference it to viewController
3. Remove the hard code and set the variable songTitle to be the text in the text field component
4. Require the text field to not be empty else the play song button would not work
